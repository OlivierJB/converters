How to use KML to UgCS route converter

This converter can generate UgCS routes of 3 types (AreaScan, Photogrammetry tool, Perimeter) from KML files.

KML files should contain Placemark element with coordinates tag.

Simple drop your KML file to corresponding CMD file and UgCS route will be created in same folder as your KML file.

Next you can create new route in UgCS, select "Import from file" and enjoy.

This converter will work only on Windows.

Good luck, 
UgCS team
